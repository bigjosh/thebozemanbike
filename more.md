Your conscience. 

## How far can I go?
As far as your imagination (and your legs) will take you, just please return it back to town when you are done.

## What is the longest I can use it for?
If you have to ask, then it is probably too long. Let other people use it too!

Text me at the number on this [page](https://thebozemanbike.com). 

## Why?
Half social experiement, half performace art peice? Why do you care?

## What is the back story?
I usually rent a bike from the excelent [Challet Sports](https://chaletsportsmt.com/) when I am in town, but this time I saw a bike outside of the Action Pawn. 
Buying it was cheaper than renting would have been, so I bought it. When it was time to go, I thought it would be a fun way to keep it alive until I come back.
